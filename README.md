> **Note** This repository is developed in .netstandard2.0

This library/ repository was created as a way to simplify the development process. Here were written the usually used methods (extension methods) for some data types like `int, string, DateTime, Enum, bool, byte, Guid`, also there was added extensions for `List, Dictionary, DynamicList(using 'System.Linq.Dynamic.Core')` and other collections(`ICollection, IEnumerable, IList, HashSet, IQueryable`).

In the repository was added an extension for `cryptography`, encrypting and decrypting string by key with RSA.

In case you need some get some documentation/comments from `Assembly`, here too are some extensions.

Also here you may find extensions for `SystemData (DbDataReader, DataRecord, DataTable)` lib, `FileStream, MemoryStream, Type`, and a lot other of methods and not the last some `Linq` and `Expression` extensions that can help to make code mode clean.

As previously, I said here are collected the most relevant and used extension methods in the life cycle of application development that allow us to improve our code, and writing speed, and use more efficiently dev team time during this period for more complex functionality.
The list of helpful methods and extensions list isn't finished, I think in a short period I'll complete it with more fun things.

I hope I'm on the right way to providing all these things to all who saw or searched for something to make easy life in development, and enjoyable. I think you will find it helpful for all projects where needed.
